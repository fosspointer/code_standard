# FossPointer Code Standard for C++

**Version 1.0**

This programming standard was made to ensure optimal code readability, efficiency, consistency and maintainability. It also aims to avoid "naming collisions*", and ensure proper namespacing practices as well.

*Naming collision**: Instance where the standard predicts that two differently typed identifiers *should* share the same type. C++ does not permit this, and thus, such cases should be minimized.
